Alright nerds, here it is:
Quines.
Taken from wikipedia: A quine is a non-empty computer program which takes no input and produces a copy of its own source code as its only output. The standard terms for these programs in the computability theory and computer science literature are "self-replicating programs", "self-reproducing programs", and "self-copying programs".

Write me some quines.

e.g.

```
➜  2-Quines git:(quines) ruby solutions/qruby.rb
_="_=%p;puts _%%_";puts _%_
➜  2-Quines git:(quines) cat solutions/qruby.rb
_="_=%p;puts _%%_";puts _%_
```
