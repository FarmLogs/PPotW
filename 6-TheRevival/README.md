# Shapes Polygons and other Misc. Shit.

Alright, I want to get better at getting this going again, and keeping it going. It lasted a little over a month last time
and now I want to try again.

For this week's challenge, it will be something simple again. I gave this question to brad a while back, and I hear that this is one of his go to questions.
Given a positive odd integer n, print an X shape the height and width of n. As a bonus, make it also print a diamond. You should be able to do this.
