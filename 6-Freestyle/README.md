Hello! Week 6!

Alright, this week is a little bit different in style. We all work with the terminal in some way shape or form here at Farmlogs. I'm sure you guys have your own scripts/aliases/functions that you have set up. Without sharing secrets/access keys (pleaaaase dont do this), share your personal scripts/functions you have written for your workstations. The idea this week is to give/share your productivity pieces with other farmloggers. Include a description/comments at the top of your script and maybe how to run it.

I didn't want to do an actual coding problem this week because the steam of PPotW had gone down, and I think this will bring people back into the PPotW spirit.

AND AGAIN. KEEP THE PASSWORDS/KEYS OUT.
