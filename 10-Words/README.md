# A Super Anagram Generator
Using the dictionary found at /usr/share/dict/words (or dict.txt) to find me some anagrams. I still want words that do not use the entire string space. Furthermore, you may continue to use the unused characters in the string space. The order of words does not matter. The list specifics also does not matter. What DOES matter is that I need to know how big a list is. Give me the total count of characters in that list.

Example "raccare" should find at LEAST the following:
```
care
racecar
car
race
are car
car race
acre a
etc etc...
```
and the resulting character count of the list above would be 36

## The Second Plottwist:
Now, find me a/the 7 character string, that generates the largest character count. ( I honestly don't know the answer. lets compare our solutions :| ( I also have a strong feeling that this is where runtime will get pushed. Post your times. ))
